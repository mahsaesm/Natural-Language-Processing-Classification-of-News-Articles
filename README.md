# Natural-Language-Processing-Classification-of-News-Articles
This project aims to enhance a baseline news classification model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By following the steps outlined in the notebook, the project seeks to improve the model's performance through various tasks.
First, it involves cleaning the dataset by removing residual HTML code and news agency names, which can interfere with accurate classification. Next, it applies stemming or lemmatization to simplify grammatical variations of words, making the data more consistent for the model. The project also tests the improved model on recent news articles to evaluate its real-world applicability and identifies any misclassifications to understand potential weaknesses.
Additionally, experimenting with different model architectures, such as increasing the number of layers or using a 1D CNN, is part of the process to find the most effective configuration. Finally, the project includes a discussion on how these steps impact the model's performance, providing insights into why certain changes may or may not lead to improvements.
